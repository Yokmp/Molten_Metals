# A small Factorio mod which adds molten ores.

This Mod is written under Factorio 1.1.33.
It inserts its data in the data stage.
The Steel and Electric Furnaces are replaced by this mods smelters which are Assembling Machine types.
This means that if other Mods add recipes for furnaces they won't be accessible.
At he moment only "vanilla-ores" (iron and copper) are affected.
If you want to add ores from other mods just edit data.lua where you'll find the two arrays at the top of the file.
